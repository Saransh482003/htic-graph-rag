Sci. 2025, 26, 3071 2 of 31 Abstract: Chronic in\ufb02ammation is a pivotal driver in the progression of atherosclerosis, signi\ufb01cantly contributing to the burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Patients with chronic in\ufb02ammatory diseases, such as in\ufb02ammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) (e.g., ulcera- tive colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease), rheumatological disorders, as well as individuals with auto-immune diseases (such as systemic lupus erythematosus), present a higher risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs). Despite their elevated CVD risk, these populations remain underrepresented in cardiovascular research, leading to a critical underestimation of their cardiovascular risk (CVR) in clinical practice. Furthermore, even recent CVR scores poorly predict the risk of events in these speci\ufb01c populations. This narrative review examines the physiopathological mechanisms linking chronic in\ufb02ammation, immunomod- ulation, atherosclerosis, thrombosis and cardiovascular events. We review data from epidemiological studies and clinical trials to explore the potential cardiovascular bene- \ufb01ts of anti-in\ufb02ammatory and immunomodulatory therapies. Despite existing evidence, signi\ufb01cant gaps in knowledge remain. Future research is mandatory, focusing on innova- tive strategies for risk strati\ufb01cation and optimization, including lipidomics, proteomics, advanced in\ufb02ammatory markers, microbiota pro\ufb01ling, and cardiovascular imaging. Ad- dressing these unmet needs will enhance understanding of cardiovascular risk in chronic in\ufb02ammatory diseases, enabling tailored interventions and better outcomes.

Introduction Chronic in\ufb02ammatory diseases (CIDs), such as in\ufb02ammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and spondyloarthropathies, are characterized by persistent immune system activation, leading to systemic in\ufb02amma- tion and multi-organ involvement. Increasing evidence highlights a strong link between chronic in\ufb02ammation and cardiovascular disease (CVD), with epidemiological studies con\ufb01rming an elevated risk of cardiovascular events in CID populations, independent of traditional risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and smoking [1\u20136]. Patients with CIDs experience a heightened burden of cardiovascular morbidity and mor- tality, driven by systemic in\ufb02ammation that fosters a pro-atherogenic state [7]. Chronic immune activation contributes to endothelial dysfunction [7], oxidative stress [8,9], and vascular remodeling [10], which collectively accelerate the development of atherosclerosis and increase the likelihood of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), including myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure [4,11]. Recognizing the cardiovascular implications of chronic in\ufb02ammation has sparked interest in novel therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating in\ufb02ammation-driven CVD risk. These approaches include the repurposing of anti-in\ufb02ammatory agents such as tumor necro- sis factor (TNF) inhibitors, interleukin (IL)-6 blockers, and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, alongside emerging biologics with immunomodulatory effects. However, concerns persist regarding the cardiovascular safety of certain immunosuppressive therapies, necessitating further research into their long-term risk\u2013bene\ufb01t pro\ufb01le [12]. The objective of this review is to provide a comprehensive description of the relationship between CIDs and CVD, emphasizing the underlying molecular and immunological mechanisms that contribute to elevated cardiovascular risk in affected individuals. Additionally, we examine current and emerging strategies for optimal cardiovascular risk management in patients with CIDs,",

Overview of Chronic In\ufb02ammatory Diseases CIDs encompass a wide range of disorders characterized by persistent in\ufb02ammation and systemic involvement. However, the present review focuses primarily on IBDs, RA, and SLE, which are among the most extensively studied. We excluded systemic and localized vasculitides, as these primarily affect blood vessels and the heart directly through vascular in\ufb02ammation, thrombosis, and endothelial dysfunction, leading to distinct CVD risk pro\ufb01les [13]. 2.1. In\ufb02ammatory Bowel Diseases IBD, which includes ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease, affects approximately 1% of the global population, with an increasing incidence worldwide. Symptoms include abdominal pain, chronic diarrhea, weight loss, and hematochezia, with alternating periods of remission and exacerbation [14]. In older adults, IBD more frequently involves the distal intestine and is associated with higher rates of complications, such as ischemic colitis, infectious colitis, colorectal cancer, and perforation [15]. The pathogenesis of IBD is complex and involves genetic predisposition, environmen- tal factors, and dysregulation of both innate and adaptive immunity [16]. Ulcerative colitis is restricted to the colon, affecting only the mucosal layer, and typically begins in the rectum, extending proximally. In contrast, Crohn\u2019s disease can affect the entire gastrointestinal tract, from the mouth to the anus, with transmural in\ufb02ammation, skip lesions, and granuloma formation [14]. Beyond the gastrointestinal tract, chronic systemic in\ufb02ammation in IBD signi\ufb01cantly impacts cardiovascular health. Systemic in\ufb02ammation driven by gut dysbiosis and altered immune signaling contributes to endothelial dysfunction, arterial stiffness, and fosters a prothrombotic state [17,18]. Studies have demonstrated that patients with IBD exhibit an increased risk of myocardial infarction, heart failure, and stroke, independent of tra- ditional cardiovascular risk factors [19,20]. Moreover, IBD patients, particularly those with active disease, have a heightened risk of venous thromboembolism, with an up to threefold increased likelihood of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism com- pared to the general population [21]. Recent clinical trials and observational studies have highlighted the impact of immunosuppressive therapies on cardiovascular risk in IBD. While biologic agents such as anti-TNF inhibitors (e.g., in\ufb02iximab, adalimumab) have been associated with a reduction in cardiovascular events [22], JAK inhibitors may carry a higher thromboembolic risk [23]. Corticosteroids, commonly used to control IBD \ufb02ares, are associ- ated with worsening cardiometabolic pro\ufb01les, including increased blood pressure, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia [22]. Understanding the interplay between systemic in\ufb02am- mation, gut microbiota, and cardiovascular risk in IBD is crucial for developing targeted preventive strategies. Management of IBD focuses on reducing in\ufb02ammation, achieving remission, and preventing relapses. Treatment options include 5-aminosalicylic acid drugs, corticosteroids, immunomodulators (e.g., azathioprine, methotrexate), and biologic agents (e.g., in\ufb02iximab, vedolizumab) [24,25]. Surgery is reserved for refractory cases, complications, or colorectal cancer risk [26,27]. 2.2. Rheumatoid Arthritis RA is a systemic autoimmune disorder affecting approximately 1% of the population, with a higher prevalence in women (3:1 female-to-male ratio). The disease primarily targets",

Autoantibodies, including rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies, drive immune-mediated joint in\ufb02ammation and systemic complications such as cardiovascular disease, interstitial lung disease, and osteoporosis [28]. RA management aims to control inflammation, prevent joint damage, and maintain func- tion through a combination of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic approaches. Methotrex- ate is the first-line disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) [29], while biologic and targeted synthetic DMARDs (e.g., TNF inhibitors, IL-6 inhibitors, JAK inhibitors) are used in cases of inadequate response or decreased effectiveness after initial treatment success [30]. Lifestyle interventions, including smoking cessation, exercise, and dietary modifications, play a critical role in disease management and CVD risk reduction [31]. 2.3. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus SLE is a multisystem autoimmune disease that predominantly affects women of child- bearing age [32]. It presents with diverse clinical manifestations, including malar rash, arthritis, nephritis, hematologic abnormalities, and serositis. Patients with SLE have a markedly increased risk of cardiovascular disease, with rates of myocardial infarction up to 50 times higher in young women with SLE compared to age-matched controls [33]. Chronic systemic in\ufb02ammation, immune complex deposition, and dysregulated interferon signaling contribute to endothelial dysfunction, accelerated atherosclerosis, and arterial thrombosis [34]. Additionally, SLE is associated with a high prevalence of metabolic syn- drome, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance, further exacerbating cardiovascular risk [35]. Antiphospholipid syndrome, which frequently coexists with SLE, further compounds car- diovascular risk by promoting a hypercoagulable state, increasing the risk of arterial and venous thrombosis [36]. Therapeutic strategies for cardiovascular prevention in SLE are evolving [32,36]. Hydroxychloroquine, a cornerstone of lupus treatment, has demonstrated cardioprotective effects [37]. Conversely, prolonged corticosteroid therapy is associated with an increased incidence of hypertension, diabetes, and atherosclerosis, necessitating careful risk\u2013bene\ufb01t assessment [38]. Emerging biologic agents, such as anifrolumab (an interferon receptor antagonist) [39] and belimumab (a B-cell inhibitor) [40], may offer car- diovascular bene\ufb01ts by reducing systemic in\ufb02ammation, though long-term cardiovascular outcomes require further investigation. 3. Pathophysiology of In\ufb02ammation and Cardiovascular Disease Atherosclerosis is a complex and multifactorial disease that extends beyond the passive accumulation of cholesterol-bound lipoproteins. Instead, it is driven by chronic in\ufb02amma- tion, oxidative stress, immune dysregulation, and endothelial dysfunction, all of which contribute to plaque formation and MACE. Endothelial dysfunction is an early and central event in atherogenesis, promoting increased vascular permeability, leukocyte adhesion, and oxidative stress. The loss of the protective endothelial glycocalyx allows for the in\ufb01ltration of in\ufb02ammatory cells and oxidized lipoproteins into the arterial intima, fostering the development of foam cells and atheromatous plaques. Persistent immune activation, characterized by elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6, exacerbates vascular remodeling and plaque instability, thereby increasing the risk of both MACE and thrombotic events [7]. Oxidative stress has been demonstrated to enhance lipid oxidation and foam cell forma- tion, thereby contributing to plaque instability [8,9]. Immune dysregulation involving macrophages, T-helper cells, and regulatory T cells has been shown to perpetuate a pro- thrombotic state, leading to vascular remodeling and heightened risk of MACE [10]. The dysfunction of endothelial progenitor cells in these patients further exacerbates vascular",

The cumulative impact of these mechanisms results in an absolute excess cardiovascular risk among patients with CIDs, positioning chronic in\ufb02ammation as a key cardiovascular risk enhancer. Key In\ufb02ammatory Markers Atherosclerotic plaques are heavily in\ufb01ltrated with in\ufb02ammatory cells, including macrophages, T lymphocytes, and dendritic cells. Plaque rupture can trigger a systemic in\ufb02ammatory response, detectable through various biomarkers. C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute-phase reactant produced in response to IL-6 stim- ulation. Research indicates CRP as a key predictor of MACE [42]. Elevated CRP levels are strongly correlated with increased mortality in coronary artery disease [43]. Fibrinogen is a coagulation factor that enhances platelet aggregation and thrombosis, with higher plasma levels linked to worse outcomes in ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction [44,45]. IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 are cytokines that drive vascular in\ufb02ammation and plaque instability, with ele- vated levels associated with increased cardiovascular mortality [46,47]. Interestingly, their inhibition using monoclonal antibodies has been explored for secondary cardiovascular protection in high-risk patients (e.g., after myocardial infarction). The CANTOS trial inves- tigated IL-1\u03b2 inhibition using canakinumab in patients with a prior myocardial infarction and persistently elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels equal to or greater than 2 mg/L. The study found that canakinumab signi\ufb01cantly reduced MACE, with the greatest bene\ufb01t observed in patients who achieved hsCRP levels below 2 mg/L following the initial dose. In patients with chronic kidney disease, canakinumab demon- strated an 18% reduction in the risk of MACE, with a more pronounced effect observed in individuals who exhibited a robust anti-in\ufb02ammatory response [48]. The RESCUE trial demonstrated that ziltivekimab, an IL-6 inhibitor, signi\ufb01cantly reduced hsCRP levels in a dose-dependent manner (up to 92% reduction) in patients with chronic kidney disease and high cardiovascular risk. Additionally, it was observed to decrease other in\ufb02ammatory and thrombotic biomarkers without affecting lipid ratios or causing serious adverse events [49]. Interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) is a pro-in\ufb02ammatory cytokine primarily produced by T cells and macrophages that plays an important role in the progression of atherosclerosis. IFN-\u03b3 promotes immune cell recruitment, enhances oxidative stress, increases foam cell formation, and destabilizes plaques by stimulating smooth muscle cell apoptosis and matrix metalloproteinase production. It is also a critical activator of the JAK/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway, which drives the in\ufb02ammatory cascade in atherosclerosis [50]. Elevated IFN-\u03b3 levels have been associated with increased plaque vulnerability, endothelial dysfunction, and adverse cardiovascular outcomes [51]. Given its role in cardiovascular disease, IFN-\u03b3 and its signaling pathways have been explored as possible therapeutic targets. Potential treatments include monoclonal antibodies like AMG811, which selectively neutralizes IFN-\u03b3, and JAK inhibitors like baricitinib and tofac- itinib, which suppress downstream IFN-\u03b3 signaling. However, substantial bene\ufb01ts on CVD risk and MACE have not been demonstrated for any of these treatments [50]. Additionally, molecules such as resveratrol and adenosine have demonstrated the potential to modulate IFN-\u03b3 activity by preventing STAT1 phosphorylation, though clinical evidence remains inconclusive [50]. Nonetheless, long-term IFN-\u03b3 inhibition poses risks due to its essential role in host immunity, necessitating further research into balancing its cardiovascular effects with immune protection [50]. Emerging evidence suggests that endothelial glycocalyx degradation products may serve as a marker of vascular dysfunction, warranting further research into glycocalyx- restoring therapies [52]. Finally, loss of endothelial integrity leads to increased expression of",

Colchicine, methotrexate, and leukotriene inhibitors have demonstrated potential bene\ufb01t by attenuating vascular in\ufb02ammation and reducing cardiovascular events [55\u201357]. 4. Clinical Trials on Cardiovascular Risk and Chronic Inflammatory Diseases Over the past two decades, numerous clinical trials have investigated pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions aimed at mitigating CVD risk in patients with CIDs.

Biologic and Targeted Synthetic Disease-Modifying Therapies: Cardiovascular Benefits and Risks RA has been extensively studied regarding the cardiovascular effects of biologic and targeted synthetic DMARDs. Several trials highlight the potential bene\ufb01ts and risks associ- ated with these therapies. Methotrexate, a cornerstone DMARD in RA, has been shown to improve vascular function and reduce carotid intima\u2013media thickness, suggesting a protective role against atherosclerosis [71,74]. In\ufb02iximab, a TNF inhibitor, has demonstrated the ability to slow atherosclerosis progression in RA patients [65]. Additionally, studies indicate that methotrexate, either alone or combined with TNF inhibitors, may reduce glycocalyx degradation markers, such as syndecan-1, supporting its vascular protective role [62]. However, concerns remain regarding the cardiovascular safety of JAK inhibitors. While baricitinib and tofacitinib have shown ef\ufb01cacy in controlling RA disease activity, trials indicate an increased risk of MACE, particularly in older patients and smokers [63,73]. Upadacitinib, another JAK inhibitor, demonstrated superior ef\ufb01cacy in achieving remission compared to abatacept but was associated with a higher incidence of MACE [75,76]. Trials comparing abatacept (targeting the human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4) and adalimumab (TNF inhibitor) in RA patients demonstrated that both therapies im- proved high-density lipoprotein (HDL) functionality; however, adalimumab had a stronger effect on increasing paraoxonase-1 activity and reducing HDL-associated in\ufb02ammatory markers [60]. These \ufb01ndings highlight that certain biologics may have more favorable lipid-modulating properties, which could impact long-term cardiovascular outcomes in RA patients. In IBD, the long-term extension of the UNIFI trial showed that subcutaneous ustek- inumab maintained clinical remission and endoscopic improvement for four years, with no MACE reported, though MACE was not a primary endpoint [86]. Similarly, the UNITI extension study on Crohn\u2019s disease demonstrated durable remission up to 92 weeks with- out an increase in serious adverse events or cardiovascular complications [88]. A trial on ozanimod, a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator for ulcerative colitis, reported no signi\ufb01cant cardiovascular safety concerns [87]. In SLE, studies evaluating anifrolumab, an interferon receptor blocker, showed promis- ing reductions in in\ufb02ammatory markers and cholesterol ef\ufb02ux capacity, which may con- tribute to cardiovascular protection [39]. Long-term data from Wallace et al. [40] showed that belimumab maintained disease control for up to 13 years, with a low incidence of cardiovascular deaths, although cardiovascular outcomes were not a primary focus. 4.2. Targeting In\ufb02ammatory Pathways for Cardiovascular Risk Reduction Recent clinical trials have underscored the potential of colchicine as an anti- in\ufb02ammatory therapy for CVD. The Colchicine Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial (COLCOT) [89] demonstrated that low-dose colchicine (0.5 mg daily) signi\ufb01cantly re- duced major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), including stroke and hospitalization for angina requiring revascularization, in patients with a recent myocardial infarction. Similarly, the LoDoCo2 trial [90] found that colchicine lowered cardiovascular event rates in patients with stable coronary artery disease, supporting its role in secondary prevention. However, \ufb01ndings from the CHANCE-3 trial [91] suggested that while colchicine exhibits anti-in\ufb02ammatory and atheroprotective effects, its bene\ufb01ts in preventing ischemic stroke and cardiovascular events remain inconsistent. Likewise, the CLEAR trial [92] indicated that colchicine may have limited ef\ufb01cacy in the acute phase post-myocardial infarction, suggesting that its cardiovascular bene\ufb01ts are in\ufb02uenced by timing and patient selection. These \ufb01ndings highlight the need for further studies to identify optimal patient populations and re\ufb01ne the role of colchicine in cardiovascular risk reduction.",

In RA, anakinra (IL-1 inhibitor) improved myocardial function, while tocilizumab (IL-6 inhibitor) enhanced vascular function [69,70]. However, clinical trials assessing IL-6 inhibition have reported mixed results [78]. While tocilizumab effectively reduces systemic in\ufb02ammation, it has been associated with increased lipid levels, raising questions about its net cardiovascular bene\ufb01t [64]. Similarly, targeted therapies in SLE, such as cenerimod (sphingosine-1-phosphate modulator) and tofacitinib (JAK inhibitor), have demonstrated improvements in lipid function and endothelial health, but their long-term cardiovascular implications remain uncertain [80,83]. 4.3. Lipid-Lowering Strategies: The Role of Statins in In\ufb02ammatory Diseases Statins play a crucial role in mitigating cardiovascular risk in CID populations. Their lipid-lowering and anti-in\ufb02ammatory properties make them particularly bene\ufb01cial for patients with chronic in\ufb02ammation. RA studies have demonstrated the ef\ufb01cacy of rosuvastatin in improving arterial stiffness and subendocardial viability ratio, though its impact on carotid intima\u2013media thickness remains inconclusive [77]. Long-term studies con\ufb01rm statin bene\ufb01ts in reducing arterial stiffness and blood pressure in in\ufb02ammatory joint diseases [67,68]. Similarly, atorvastatin has been shown to improve lipid pro\ufb01les and in\ufb02ammation in RA patients, with recent trials reporting a signi\ufb01cant reduction in cardiovascular event risk [61,72]. In SLE, a randomized controlled trial by Plazak et al. [85] demonstrated that atorvas- tatin halted the progression of coronary artery calci\ufb01cations and improved myocardial perfusion using imaging endpoints. Fatemi et al. [82] found that atorvastatin improved lipid pro\ufb01le and in\ufb02ammatory markers in SLE, but the short follow-up precluded assess- ment of cardiovascular event reduction. Similarly, Mok et al. [84] reported that rosuvastatin lowered homocysteine and endothelial activation markers in SLE patients with subclinical atherosclerosis but had limited impact on carotid intima\u2013media thickness progression. While research on statins in IBD and SLE is limited, given their overall cardiovascular protective effects, they may be considered an essential component of CVD risk management in CID populations [81]. 4.4. Alternative and Complementary Approaches to Cardiovascular Risk Reduction In addition to pharmacological interventions, alternative approaches have been ex- plored for reducing cardiovascular risk in CIDs. Puerarin, a bioactive compound from traditional Chinese medicine, has been investigated for its potential bene\ufb01ts in RA patients, showing reductions in carotid intima\u2013media thickness and insulin resistance [79]. However, larger placebo-controlled trials are required before it can be recommended for routine use. Exercise-based interventions, including high-intensity interval training (HIIT), have been studied in in\ufb02ammatory rheumatic diseases. Trials suggest that supervised and smartphone-assisted HIIT programs can improve VO2max and overall cardiovascular health in these populations, highlighting the role of structured physical activity in cardio- vascular risk management [66]. 4.5. Treat-to-Target Strategies for Cardiovascular Risk Management Structured cardiovascular risk management programs have shown promise in im- proving cardiovascular outcomes in CID patients. Treat-to-target (T2T) strategies, which involve aggressive control of in\ufb02ammation and metabolic risk factors, have been tested in RA. Trials indicate that carotid intima\u2013media thickness progression is signi\ufb01cantly lower in RA patients following T2T approaches, particularly in those without metabolic syndrome [58,59].",

Lessons Learned and Perspectives The cumulative evidence highlights the complex interplay between chronic in\ufb02am- mation and cardiovascular risk, emphasizing the need for integrated treatment strategies. Aggressive lipid lowering with statins, careful selection of biologic and targeted synthetic DMARDs, and structured cardiovascular risk management programs can signi\ufb01cantly improve long-term cardiovascular outcomes in CID patients. While biologics, particularly TNF inhibitors and IL-6 blockers, show potential cardiovascular bene\ufb01ts, concerns persist about the cardiovascular safety of JAK inhibitors. It is worth noting that dedicated clinical trials evaluating cardiovascular risk reduction strategies in patients with SLE and IBD are lacking. Most of the current evidence regarding cardiovascular risk in these populations stems from observational studies rather than randomized controlled trials, which limits the strength of the recommendations that can be made. Moreover, clinical trials in CIDs face several limitations that constrain our understanding of cardiovascular risk reduction strategies. Most are designed primarily to assess disease control and safety, with cardiovascular outcomes included only as secondary or exploratory endpoints. As a result, these trials are often underpowered to detect MACE, and follow-up durations are typically too short to capture long-term vascular effects. Patient populations are frequently unrepresentative of real-world clinical practice, with older adults, individuals with pre-existing cardiovascular disease, and those with multiple comorbidities commonly excluded. This limits the applicability of \ufb01ndings to high-risk groups. Many studies rely on surrogate markers, such as CRP or carotid intima\u2013media thickness, which may not reliably predict clinical bene\ufb01t. The limited use of advanced cardiovascular imaging and longitudinal biomarker monitoring reduces our ability to detect subclinical disease progression and therapeutic impact. Future research should prioritize the re\ufb01nement of cardiovascular risk strati\ufb01cation tools, the evaluation of novel preventive and therapeutic strategies, and the long-term assessment of immunomodulatory therapies in patients with chronic in\ufb02ammatory dis- eases. Integrating cardiovascular risk management into routine care, particularly within rheumatology, gastroenterology, and dermatology, will be essential to mitigate excess cardio- vascular morbidity and mortality. A multidisciplinary, proactive approach has the potential to significantly improve both cardiovascular and overall outcomes in this high-risk population. 5. Management Strategies The optimal management of CVD risk in patients with CIDs requires a multicompo- nent approach that integrates regular screening, patient empowerment, risk strati\ufb01cation beyond traditional models, timely lipid-lowering therapy, and comprehensive lifestyle modi\ufb01cations (Table 2). Table 2. Potential strategies for risk assessment, optimization, and management in patients with chronic in\ufb02ammatory diseases.

Regular Screening and Cardiovascular Risk Strati\ufb01cation Traditional cardiovascular risk scores, such as SCORE2 for 10-year risk of MACE or Life-CVD2 for lifetime risk, estimate the risk of major cardiovascular events but do not fully account for the pro-in\ufb02ammatory burden of CIDs. As a result, cardiovascular risk in patients with CIDs may be underestimated, leading to delayed intervention [93]. To improve risk prediction and early detection, a more re\ufb01ned screening strategy should be implemented, particularly in CID patients who may develop subclinical atherosclerosis despite normal low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. Among available risk models, the Reynolds Risk Score [94] and QRISK [95] have been shown to be more adapted to risk estimation in RA and SLE patients, as they integrate in\ufb02ammatory markers and chronic disease burden. Proactive cardiovascular risk assessment should be integrated into routine care, partic- ularly in patients with long-standing disease or frequent \ufb02ares, including comprehensive evaluation that integrates CVD risk biomarkers, including lipoprotein(a) [96], in\ufb02ammatory biomarkers (e.g., CRP, IL-6, \ufb01brinogen), chronic in\ufb02ammatory burden, and disease activ- ity scores. Non-invasive imaging techniques, including carotid intima\u2013media thickness, coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring, and echocardiography, may help to assess early vascular damage [97]. Cardiovascular risk management should account for disease activity and corticosteroid exposure [17,98]. In SLE, antiphospholipid antibody status should be assessed, with aggressive thromboembolism prevention strategies for high-risk individu- als [36]. Frequent cardiovascular assessments should be performed in high-risk patients, especially older adults, those with long-standing disease, or those receiving therapies with known cardiovascular risks (e.g., JAK inhibitors) [99,100]. 5.2. The Role of Cardiovascular Imaging in Chronic In\ufb02ammatory Diseases Cardiovascular imaging plays a crucial role in the early detection and risk strati\ufb01cation of atherosclerosis in patients with CIDs [97]. Traditional imaging modalities remain foundational in clinical practice and provide substantial value in cardiovascular risk assessment. Carotid ultrasound is a non-invasive, widely available, and cost-effective method that enables the detection of carotid plaques and arterial thickening, which correlate with systemic atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events. Patients with CIDs frequently exhibit elevated levels of subclinical, early-stage atherosclerosis, which can be detected using carotid ultrasound [101,102]. CAC scoring, obtained via non-contrast computed tomography (CT), is one of the most validated imaging tools for cardiovascular risk strati\ufb01cation in asymptomatic individuals, including those with CIDs. Emerging evidence suggests that incorporating CAC scoring into cardiovascular risk assessment provides incremental predictive value beyond traditional risk factors and can unmask high-risk pro\ufb01les that may be underestimated by conventional scoring systems [103,104]. Moreover, it signi\ufb01cantly improves the prediction of MACE in CID populations [103,105]. Coronary CT angiography is another well-established technique that offers comprehensive visualization of coronary anatomy, plaque burden, and stenosis severity, aiding in the identi\ufb01cation of subclinical coronary artery disease [106,107]. Among emerging imaging modalities, photon-counting computed tomography (PCCT) represents a signi\ufb01cant advancement over conventional CT imaging, offering improved spatial resolution, superior tissue characterization, and enhanced signal-to-noise ratio [108]. A key advantage of PCCT in cardiovascular imaging is its ability to detect low-attenuation plaques, which are highly predictive of future adverse cardiovascular events [109]. These plaques, characterized by a necrotic core and lipid-rich composition, are more prone to rupture, leading to acute coronary syndromes. PCCT enables the visual- ization of these vulnerable plaques with greater accuracy than conventional CT, providing",

Addition- ally, PCCT enhances the assessment of vascular in\ufb02ammation by offering higher contrast resolution, enabling better detection of arterial wall thickening, microcalci\ufb01cations, and early-stage \ufb01brosis [110]. Beyond plaque characterization, PCCT improves the evaluation of CAC, a well-established marker of subclinical atherosclerosis [111]. This re\ufb01ned anal- ysis is particularly relevant for CID patients, as they often develop atherosclerosis at an accelerated rate [112]. 5.3. Patient Empowerment in Cardiovascular Risk Management Empowering patients with knowledge and self-monitoring tools can signi\ufb01cantly improve cardiovascular outcomes [113,114]. Regular home blood pressure monitoring is essential, as hypertension is a common but modi\ufb01able risk factor for CVD. In addition, awareness campaigns highlighting the link between chronic in\ufb02ammation and CVD can educate patients about their increased cardiovascular risk, even when traditional risk factors are well controlled. Promoting lifestyle accountability also empowers patients to actively track their diet, exercise and adhere to their medication regimen through mobile health applications or regular check-ins with healthcare providers, fostering long-term engagement in their cardiovascular health. 5.4. Accounting for CIDs as Risk Modi\ufb01ers in Cardiovascular Risk Estimation A major limitation of current cardiovascular risk models is their failure to account for CIDs as independent risk modi\ufb01ers [93]. The burden of CIDs should be explicitly incorporated into 10-year and lifetime cardiovascular risk assessment models to ensure that appropriate preventive measures are implemented. Personalized risk assessment algorithms should incorporate disease duration, severity, and in\ufb02ammatory activity into CVD risk calculation. Stronger preventive efforts, including earlier initiation of statins and tighter blood pressure control, should be considered for CID patients even if traditional risk scores suggest low or moderate risk. 5.5. Lipid-Lowering Strategies: Beyond LDL Reduction Statin therapy remains a cornerstone of cardiovascular prevention, particularly in patients with CVD, where its anti-in\ufb02ammatory effects provide additional vascular bene\ufb01ts. In addition to lowering LDL cholesterol, statins modulate in\ufb02ammatory pathways, improv- ing endothelial function and reducing pro-in\ufb02ammatory cytokine production [115,116]. Early, appropriate, and long-term lipid-lowering therapy should be prioritized even in patients without overt dyslipidemia because of their underlying in\ufb02ammatory risk. If LDL targets are not achieved, non-statin lipid-lowering agents (e.g., PCSK9 inhibitors, ezetimibe, bempedoic acid) may be added based on individual risk pro\ufb01les. Statins should be an inte- gral part of CID management, particularly in patients on JAK inhibitors or those with longer disease duration, because of their ability to reduce in\ufb02ammation-related cardiovascular risk [117]. 5.6. Lifestyle Modi\ufb01cations: The Foundation of Cardiovascular Prevention Lifestyle modi\ufb01cation remains the most effective and cost-effective strategy for long- term cardiovascular health in CID patients [118]. Smoking cessation is critical, as tobacco use increases in\ufb02ammation and vascular damage [118]. Adherence to an anti-in\ufb02ammatory diet, particularly the Mediterranean diet, which is rich in polyphenols, omega-3 fatty acids, and \ufb01ber, provides cardioprotective and anti-in\ufb02ammatory bene\ufb01t [119,120]. However, patients with Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis, particularly those with active disease or intestinal strictures, may require dietary modi\ufb01cations to reduce \ufb01ber intake while maintaining nutrient density and preventing malnutrition [121]. Finally, management of",

Sci. 2025, 26, 3071 21 of 31 weight and body fat is essential, as obesity exacerbates in\ufb02ammation and contributes to metabolic dysregulation, further increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease [122,123]. 5.7. The Role of Physical Activity Across All Ages Physical activity is fundamental to cardiovascular health, symptom management, and overall well-being in patients with CIDs [124]; however, exercise prescription should be tailored to age, disease severity, and functional capacity. In young adults, resistance train- ing should be emphasized because it improves vascular function, reduces in\ufb02ammatory markers, and maintains musculoskeletal health. In older adults, progressive resistance training should be integrated with balance and coordination exercises, which help reduce the risk of frailty, osteoporosis, and falls while improving cardiovascular markers [125]. HIIT may be bene\ufb01cial for some patients, particularly those with in\ufb02ammatory arthritis, as it has been shown to improve VO2 max and endothelial function [66]. Regardless of disease status, patients should be encouraged to incorporate daily exercise, even in the presence of fatigue or mild joint pain, as exercise has potent anti-in\ufb02ammatory effects beyond its direct cardiovascular bene\ufb01ts [124]. 5.8. Vaccination and Cardiovascular Risk Reduction in Chronic In\ufb02ammatory Diseases Vaccination is a key strategy in reducing in\ufb02ammation and preventing MACE in patients with CIDs. Respiratory infections such as in\ufb02uenza and pneumococcal pneumonia are linked to heightened systemic in\ufb02ammation, endothelial dysfunction, and increased CVD risk, including acute coronary syndromes and stroke [126]. Patients with RA, SLE, IBDs, and other CIDs face a higher risk of severe infections due to immune dysregulation and immunosuppressive therapies, which can exacerbate in\ufb02ammation, trigger disease \ufb02ares, and elevate CVD risk. Following international guidelines, CID patients should receive in\ufb02uenza, pneumococcal (PCV13, PPSV23), tetanus toxoid, hepatitis A and B, HPV, and herpes zoster vaccines as part of routine preventive care [127,128]. Live vaccines (e.g., measles, mumps and rubella vaccination) should generally be avoided in immunosup- pressed individuals but may be considered prior to immunosuppressive therapy initiation. Screening for hepatitis B, varicella-zoster virus, and HPV is recommended before starting immunosuppressive treatment, and whenever possible, vaccinations should be adminis- tered in advance to optimize immune response [127,128]. To improve vaccine coverage, healthcare providers should assess vaccination status annually, proactively recommend immunization, and address concerns about safety and ef\ufb01cacy, particularly in immuno- suppressed patients [129]. Increasing awareness through patient education and provider engagement is crucial [130]. The use of electronic health records for vaccination reminders shows promise in improving adherence, though further research is needed to assess its full potential [131]. Future studies may re\ufb01ne vaccination strategies by improving ef\ufb01cacy data, optimizing booster schedules, and tailoring recommendations based on disease activity and immunosuppressive treatments. 5.9. Interdisciplinary Collaboration for Comprehensive Cardiovascular Risk Management in Chronic In\ufb02ammatory Diseases Effective management requires a collaborative, multidisciplinary approach involving rheumatologists, gastroenterologists, cardiologists, internal medicine specialists, surgeons, nutritionists, and exercise specialists [132]. Rheumatologists and gastroenterologists should work closely with cardiologists to develop personalized cardiovascular risk reduction strate- gies. Internal medicine specialists help coordinate care for metabolic comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes. Dietitians provide tailored nutritional guidance to optimize metabolic health and control in\ufb02ammation, while exercise specialists facilitate structured physical activity programs aimed at improving cardiovascular \ufb01tness without exacerbating",

Nurses play a critical role in patient education, adherence and ongoing monitoring to ensure early detection of complications and reinforce lifestyle changes. This integrated care model improves patient outcomes and ensures that cardiovascular risk reduction is seamlessly integrated into CID management [133,134]. 6. Gaps in Knowledge, Emerging Research, and Future Directions Despite signi\ufb01cant progress in understanding cardiovascular risk in CID populations, several important gaps remain (Table 3). The ultimate goal of future research efforts should be to facilitate precision medicine, enabling individualized treatment strategies based on patient-speci\ufb01c molecular, genetic, and in\ufb02ammatory pro\ufb01les.

Improving Cardiovascular Risk Prediction in Chronic In\ufb02ammatory Diseases Current cardiovascular risk assessment tools do not fully capture the impact of chronic in\ufb02ammation on atherosclerosis and vascular dysfunction. The lack of large, longitudi- nal studies focusing on CID-related cardiovascular risk hinders accurate risk assessment and highlights the need for future research to address key gaps [93]. Re\ufb01ning risk pre- diction tools requires incorporating in\ufb02ammatory markers, disease activity scores, and emerging multi-omics data. The latter include microbiome pro\ufb01ling to assess gut\u2013immune interactions in CVD [18], metabolomics and lipidomics, to identify biochemical pathways linking chronic in\ufb02ammation to atherogenesis [135], proteomics and transcriptomics to explore systemic in\ufb02ammatory pathways and develop new biomarkers for cardiovascular risk [136]. In addition to traditional risk scores, polygenic risk scores (PRSs) have emerged as a promising tool for re\ufb01ning cardiovascular risk strati\ufb01cation. PRS aggregates the cumulative effect of multiple genetic variants associated with cardiovascular disease to estimate an individual\u2019s inherited susceptibility to atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, and other cardiovascular events. Unlike conventional risk models that primarily rely on clinical and biochemical parameters, PRS can help identify individuals at high cardiovascular risk",

        "text": "Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3071 23 of 31 even before clinical manifestations appear [137]. Further research may evaluate whether incorporating PRS into cardiovascular risk prediction models signi\ufb01cantly improves risk strati\ufb01cation in populations with CIDs. In that way, PRS could serve as an early warning tool to prioritize closer cardiovascular surveillance and aggressive cardiovascular pre- vention strategies in CID patients, particularly those who do not exhibit traditional risk factors such as hyperlipidemia or hypertension. Moreover, PRS may offer insights into the differential cardiovascular risk across various CIDs subtypes. Since autoimmune diseases disproportionately affect women, future studies should also explore sex-speci\ufb01c cardiovascular risk factors to develop tailored prevention strategies that account for differences in in\ufb02ammatory burden, hormonal in\ufb02uences, and disease phenotype [138]. 6.2. Role of Chronic In\ufb02ammation in Primary vs. Secondary Prevention While chronic in\ufb02ammation plays a well-established role in secondary cardiovascular prevention, its in\ufb02uence in primary prevention remains less understood [139]. A major research priority is to determine whether in\ufb02ammation drives the \ufb01rst cardiovascular event with the same intensity as it does recurrent events, which would re\ufb01ne preventive treatment thresholds in CID populations. Targeted anti-in\ufb02ammatory therapies, including colchicine, TNF inhibitors, IL-6 inhibitors, and IL-1 blockers, have demonstrated cardiovas- cular protective effects in select populations [139], but their long-term safety and ef\ufb01cacy in CID patients require further investigation. Future trials should compare the bene\ufb01ts of early intervention with immunomodulatory therapies versus conventional lipid-lowering and antihypertensive strategies to establish optimal management guidelines. Additionally, the role of gut microbiota in systemic in\ufb02ammation and cardiovascular disease remains an area of active research. Dysbiosis, commonly observed in IBD and other in\ufb02ammatory dis- eases, may contribute to atherogenesis through alterations in lipid metabolism, endothelial dysfunction, and immune activation [18]. Future studies should investigate the potential of gut-targeted interventions, such as probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation, in reducing cardiovascular risk in CID populations. Moreover, the identi\ufb01cation of novel, non-invasive biomarkers, such as oncostatin M, an IL-6 family cytokine, may improve risk strati\ufb01cation by more accurately predicting disease activity and cardiovascular risk, ultimately aiding in the development of targeted prevention strategies [140,141]. 6.3. The Future of Cardiovascular Imaging in Chronic In\ufb02ammatory Diseases The incorporation of advanced cardiovascular imaging techniques is critical for early atherosclerosis detection and personalized risk strati\ufb01cation in CID patients. PCCT and arti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI)-enhanced imaging allow for a more detailed characterization of coronary artery disease [142]. Future research should focus on validating PCCT and CAC scoring in CID-speci\ufb01c cardiovascular risk models, developing imaging-based in- \ufb02ammatory risk markers to assess disease activity and cardiovascular risk in real time, as well as exploring the cost-effectiveness and accessibility of advanced imaging for routine cardiovascular risk assessment in CID patients. 6.4. Integrating AI and Big Data into Clinical Practice The integration of AI and machine learning algorithms into cardiovascular risk assess- ment holds great promise for improving precision medicine for CID patients. AI-based models can analyze large-scale multi-omics datasets that incorporate clinical, genetic, proteomic, and imaging data to re\ufb01ne risk prediction and facilitate personalized ther- apy [143,144]. Future research should focus on identifying early cardiovascular disease phenotypes in CID patients through AI-driven analysis, allowing for earlier intervention and risk reduction.

However, key challenges such as data standardization, compu- tational resource requirements, and interpretability of AI models for clinical use must be addressed to ensure widespread adoption and clinical reliability [142]. 7. Conclusions CIDs signi\ufb01cantly increase cardiovascular risk through persistent systemic in\ufb02amma- tion, endothelial dysfunction, and immune dysregulation. Despite strong epidemiological and mechanistic evidence, current cardiovascular risk models do not fully account for chronic in\ufb02ammation, highlighting the need for improved risk strati\ufb01cation. Early screen- ing, lipid-lowering therapy, targeted anti-in\ufb02ammatory treatments, and tailored exercise programs are essential to reduce cardiovascular events in CID patients. While biologic and targeted synthetic DMARDs show potential bene\ufb01t, their long-term cardiovascular safety requires further study. The integration of AI-driven analytics and multi-omics approaches may improve risk prediction and personalized therapy. Future research should focus on re- \ufb01ning risk assessment, evaluating novel biomarkers, and optimizing prevention strategies to improve long-term cardiovascular outcomes in CID.
