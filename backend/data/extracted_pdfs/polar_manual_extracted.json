Polar H9 is a high quality heart rate sensor for your everyday sports. It comes with the Polar Soft Strap and tracks your heart rate accurately. Polar H9 is ideal with the Polar Beat app as well as many 3rd party apps: you can turn your phone into a fitness tracker easily. Further, Bluetooth\u00ae, ANT+\u2122 and 5 kHz technologies ensure connections to a large variety of sports devices and gym equipment. Thanks to chest strap measurement Polar H9 reacts instantaneously to what happens in your body and gives you accurate calorie burn. The latest version of this user manual and video tutorials can be found at support.polar.com/en/h9-heart-rate-sensor.",

        "text": "5 3. Attach the connector. Detach the connector from the strap and rinse the strap under running water after every use. Sweat and moisture may keep the electrodes wet and the heart rate sensor activated. This will reduce the transmitter battery life. For more information, see Caring for your heart rate sensor. Getting started Polar H9 heart rate sensor is compatible with Bluetooth\u00ae and ANT+\u2122 devices that support heart rate service. A separate application is required to view heart rate data on the receiving device (for example, a smartphone). It is recommended to use the Polar Beat application but it is also possible to use other applications. Note that the H9 transmits your heart rate signal simultaneously via Bluetooth and ANT+. You can turn off the ANT+ transmission from the Beat settings under HR sensor. If you have a Polar Flow account Polar Beat automatically synchronizes your training files to it. Please note that you must sign in to your Polar Flow account when starting Polar Beat for the synchronization to work. When using the Polar H9 for the first time, you need to pair the heart rate sensor with your receiving device. For more information on pairing, see the mobile application manufacturer's instructions. Polar H9 heart rate sensor is also compatible with Polar training computers using GymLink (5 kHz) technology. For more information, go to support.polar.com. To ensure sufficient transmission range from your Polar H9 heart rate sensor to the receiving device, keep the device in front of you. A good place is in a front pocket or fixed on a belt. Do not wear the receiving device on your back (for example, in a back pocket or backpack).",

        "text": "6 Pairing Pair with Polar Beat The heart rate sensor needs to be paired directly in the Polar Beat app. To pair a heart rate sensor with Polar Beat: 1. Wear the sensor. 2. Open Polar Beat app on your Android or iOS device. 3. Go to the settings section of the app and find HR sensor. When your sensor is found, tap PAIR. Note that the H9 transmits your heart rate signal simultaneously via Bluetooth and ANT+. You can turn off the ANT+ transmission from the Beat settings under HR sensor. Pair with a Polar wrist unit You need to wear the sensor when pairing it. Check the user manual of your Polar wrist unit at support.polar.com for specific pairing instructions. Using your heart rate sensor in water Polar H9 heart rate sensor is water resistant. The GymLink technology can be used in water activities, but Bluetooth\u00ae wireless technology will not work in water. Please notice that sea and pool water are very conductive, and electrodes may short-circuit, preventing electrically measured signals from being detected by the heart rate sensor. When using a bathing suit, the best performance is achieved by wearing the heart rate sensor underneath it. Firmware update With the Polar H9 heart rate sensor, we\u2019ll be able to bring updates to your sensor to improve it or even bring new functionalities to it. You\u2019ll be able to update the firmware via the Polar Beat or Polar Flow mobile app. To receive the firmware updates, your H9 heart rate sensor needs to be paired with the Polar Beat or Polar Flow app, Android or iOS. The app will let you know if there's an update available and will guide you through it. Sensor pairing with a Polar or third-party device or app is required after a reset, update, or battery replacement if you are using a firmware version earlier than 1.2.1 for H9. See instructions. Caring for your heart rate sensor Follow the care instructions to ensure reliable heart rate measurements and prolong the lifespan of the textile strap, which wears out over time like any other piece of clothing. Maintaining the cleanliness of both the sensor and the strap keeps the device in optimal operational condition and comfortable to wear. Also, remember to store the heart rate sensor properly. The following instructions will help you fulfill guarantee obligations.",

        "text": "7 Connector After every use To prevent snap oxidation and battery drain: l detach the connector from both strap snaps l rinse the connector under running water and dry with a soft towel. When needed l Clean the connector with a mild soap and water solution. Never use alcohol, disinfectant or any abrasive material (steel, wool or cleaning chemicals). l Never put the connector in a washing machine or dryer. Strap After every use l Rinse the strap under running water. l Hang to dry, but avoid direct sunlight. After every five workouts or at least once a week l Wash the strap in a washing machine in 40\u00b0C / 104 \u00b0F. Lower temperatures do not remove impurities from the electrode material, and higher temperature can damage the strap. Do not use bleach or fabric softener. l Do not soak, iron, dry clean or bleach the strap. Check the label on your strap for detailed washing instructions. l Using a washing bag is recommended. l Do not put the strap in a dryer or use drying program of a washing machine. l Remember to detach the connector from the strap before washing. l We highly recommend machine washing. However, you can also hand wash the strap using lukewarm water (40\u00b0C / 104\u00b0F) with a mild dish soap. Rinse the strap thoroughly after washing and hang it to dry, but avoid direct sunlight. Do not use moisturizing soaps or any soaps that include skin softeners, because they can leave residue on the strap. Never use alcohol, disinfectant or any abrasive material (steel, wool or cleaning chemicals).",

        "text": "8 Other things to take into account l Do not stretch the strap or bend the electrode areas sharply, as it could damage the strap. l Wash the strap and the sensor after every use in sea water or in a pool with high chlorine content. Dirt impairs the elasticity and functioning of the strap. Wash the strap often to maintain its functionality and maximize its lifespan. If desired, the strap can be washed daily. Remember, the strap doesn\u2019t last forever; it wears out like any other garment you regularly wear and wash. Even when the strap appears to be in good condition, the electrodes inside of it could be worn out, causing unreliable readings. Replacement straps are available as accessories when yours become worn out. Storing l Dry and store the heart rate sensor strap and the connector separately to maximize the heart rate sensor battery life. l Wash the strap and the connector before long-term storage. l Keep the heart rate sensor in a cool and dry place. l Do not store the heart rate sensor while it\u2019s wet in non-breathing material, such as a sports bag, to prevent snap oxidation. l Do not expose the heart rate sensor to direct sunlight for extended periods. Batteries The battery level of your heart rate sensor is displayed on the receiving device. All connectors have user changeable batteries. To change the battery yourself, follow the instructions below. 1. Lever the battery cover open by using the clip on the strap. 2. Remove the old battery from the battery cover.",

If the sealing ring is damaged, replace it with a new one*. 5. Put the battery cover back in place. First align the ledge on the battery cover with the slot on the connector, hold the ledge in place with your finger and then press the other side of the battery cover back into place. You should hear a snap. Ensure that the battery cover is properly closed to keep the sealing ring in place and to maintain the sensor\u2019s waterproofness.
