        "text": "Type 2 diabetes is a chronic medical condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Unmanaged diabetes may lead to blindness, kidney failure, heart disease, and other serious conditions. Before diagnosis, your blood sugar levels may be high \u2014 but not high enough to indicate diabetes. This is known as prediabetes. Taking a test like this one \ue90f can help you figure out your risk factors for this condition. It\u2019s estimated that up to 37% of people with untreated prediabetes develop type 2 diabetes within 4 years (1 \ue90f). Here are 11 ways to lower your risk of getting diabetes. The quantity and quality of your carb intake are both important factors to consider when making dietary changes to help prevent diabetes. Your body breaks down carbs into small sugar molecules, which are absorbed into your bloodstream. The resulting rise in blood sugar stimulates your pancreas to produce insulin, a hormone that helps sugar move from your bloodstream into your cells. In people with prediabetes, the body\u2019s cells are resistant to insulin, so blood sugar remains high. To compensate, the pancreas produces more insulin, attempting to bring blood sugar down. Over time, this can lead to progressively higher blood sugar and insulin levels until the condition turns into type 2 diabetes. ADVERTISEMENT 1.

        "text": "Many studies link frequent added sugar or refined carb intake and diabetes risk. What\u2019s more, replacing these items with foods that have less of an effect on blood sugar may reduce your risk (2 \ue90f, 3 \ue90f, 4 \ue90f). However, all carb sources \u2014 not just sugar and refined carbs \u2014 stimulate the release of insulin. Although refined carbs are digested more rapidly than complex carbs, there\u2019s mixed evidence that a food\u2019s blood sugar increase is correlated with diabetes risk (5 \ue90f). Therefore, managing overall carb intake and choosing carbs that are high in fiber are likely better solutions for preventing diabetes than just limiting highly processed carbs. Examples of foods and drinks high in added sugars or refined carbs include soda, candy, dessert, white bread, pasta, and sweetened breakfast cereal. Non-starchy vegetables like broccoli and mushrooms, whole fruit, oatmeal, and whole grain bread and pasta are healthier swaps. These options are higher in fiber, which helps mitigate spikes in blood sugar. Lean proteins like fish and healthy fats from olive oil, avocado, nuts, and seeds also have less of an effect on blood sugar. They\u2019re great additions to your diet to help prevent type 2 diabetes (4 \ue90f). SUMMARY Eating foods high in refined carbs and sugar increase blood sugar and insulin levels, which may eventually lead to diabetes. Limiting total carbohydrate intake and choosing options that don\u2019t cause blood sugar spikes may help reduce your risk. 8/20/25, 2:54 PM How to Prevent Type 2 Diabetes: 11 Methods https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/prevent-diabetes#3-Drink-water-as-your-primary-beverage 3/21",

        "text": "Doing physical activity regularly may help prevent diabetes. People with prediabetes often have reduced insulin sensitivity, also known as insulin resistance. In this state, your pancreas has to make more insulin to get sugar out of your blood and into cells (6 \ue90f). Exercise increases the insulin sensitivity of your cells, meaning that you need less insulin to manage your blood sugar levels (7 \ue90f). Many types of physical activity have been shown to reduce insulin resistance and blood sugar in adults with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes. These include aerobic exercise, high intensity interval training (HIIT), and strength training (8 \ue90f, 9 \ue90f, 10 \ue90f, 11 \ue90f).

        "text": "One study in 29 people with type 2 diabetes found that HIIT, which involves bursts of intense activity followed by brief recoveries, led to improved blood sugar management and longer sessions of endurance training (8 \ue90f). However, you don\u2019t need to do HIIT to reap benefits. Short exercise bouts that last as little as 10 minutes, such as brisk walking, are great options. If you\u2019re just beginning an exercise routine, start with short workouts and work up to 150 minutes per week (12). SUMMARY Exercising regularly may increase insulin sensitivity, which may in turn help prevent diabetes. Sticking with water as your drink of choice will help you limit beverages that are high in sugar. Sugary beverages like soda and sweetened fruit juice have been linked to an increased risk of both type 2 diabetes and latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA). One large observational study in 2,800 people found that those who drank more than 2 servings of sugary beverages per day had a 99% and 20% increased risk of LADA and type 2 diabetes, respectively (13 \ue90f).

In contrast, increased water intake may lead to better blood sugar management and insulin response (15 \ue90f, 16 \ue90f). One 24-week study showed that adults with overweight who replaced diet sodas with water while following a weight loss program experienced a decrease in insulin resistance, fasting blood sugar, and insulin levels (16 \ue90f).

Research also links smoking to type 2 diabetes. While the mechanisms aren\u2019t fully understood, it\u2019s thought that smoking may increase insulin resistance and inhibit insulin secretion (22 \ue90f, 23 \ue90f, 24 \ue90f). Plus, heavy, more frequent smoking is linked to a higher risk of diabetes than smoking fewer cigarettes (23 \ue90f, 25 \ue90f). Importantly, studies suggest that quitting smoking may reduce diabetes risk (25 \ue90f). One large study in more than 53,000 Japanese adults found that diabetes risk in those who smoke decreases over time after quitting. Smoking cessation for 10 or more years may even decrease this risk to about the same level as those who never smoked (25 \ue90f).

Conversely, eating smaller portions may lead to reduced calorie intake and subsequent weight loss, which may in turn lower your risk of diabetes. While there are few studies on the effects of portion management in people with prediabetes, research in those with type 2 diabetes offers some insight.

To manage your portion sizes, make your plate half non-starchy vegetables, a quarter lean protein, and a quarter complex carbs like fruit or whole grains. If you\u2019re at a restaurant that serves large portions, choose an appetizer for your main course or ask for a half portion. Plus, instead of eating snacks straight out of the bag, place your desired amount into a separate dish. SUMMARY Avoiding large portion sizes may help reduce insulin and blood sugar levels, promote weight loss, and decrease your risk of diabetes. It\u2019s important to avoid sedentary behaviors, such as getting very little physical activity or sitting during most of the day, to help prevent diabetes. Observational studies consistently link sedentary behavior and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (29 \ue90f). One study in more than 6,000 older women found that those who had the highest amount of sedentary time per day \u2014 10 or more hours \u2014 were more than twice as likely to develop diabetes than those with 8.3 hours or less of sedentary time (30). Changing sedentary behavior can be as simple as standing up from your desk and walking around for a few minutes every half hour. Wearing a fitness watch or device that reminds you to walk at least 250 steps per hour may also be helpful. Still, it can be hard to reverse firmly entrenched habits.

As such, it\u2019s important to set realistic and achievable goals, such as standing while talking on the phone or taking the stairs instead of the elevator. SUMMARY Limiting sedentary time, including prolonged sitting, has been shown to reduce your risk of diabetes. Eating plenty of fiber is beneficial for gut health and weight management. It may also help prevent diabetes. Studies in people with prediabetes and older women with obesity show that this nutrient helps keep blood sugar and insulin levels low (32 \ue90f, 33 \ue90f). Fiber can be divided into two broad categories: soluble, which absorbs water, and insoluble, which doesn\u2019t. Soluble fiber and water form a gel in your digestive tract that slows down food absorption, leading to a more gradual rise in blood sugar. Thus, eating more soluble fiber may reduce fasting blood sugar and insulin levels (34 \ue90f, 35 \ue90f). Insoluble fiber has also been linked to reductions in blood sugar levels (36 \ue90f). While many studies on fiber and diabetes use fiber supplements instead of high fiber foods, getting more fiber from foods is likely beneficial. SUMMARY 8.

Vitamin D is important for blood sugar management. Indeed, studies link vitamin D deficiency to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (37 \ue90f, 38 \ue90f). Some studies also show that vitamin D supplements may improve many aspects of blood sugar management in people with prediabetes, compared with control groups (38 \ue90f, 39 \ue90f, 40 \ue90f). However, current research is mixed on whether vitamin D supplements prevent the progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes (40 \ue90f, 41 \ue90f). Still, maintaining adequate vitamin D levels is important for your health, especially if you\u2019re deficient. Good food sources include fatty fish and cod liver oil. In addition, sun exposure can increase vitamin D levels. For some people, supplementing with vitamin D daily may be necessary to achieve and maintain optimal levels.

Thus, processed foods, which include plain yogurt and frozen vegetables, aren\u2019t inherently unhealthy. Yet, highly processed foods have undergone significantly more processing and often contain added sugars, unhealthy fats, and chemical preservatives. Examples include hot dogs, chips, frozen desserts, sodas, and candy bars. Observational research associates diets high in ultra-processed foods with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes (42 \ue90f). Conversely, cutting back on packaged foods that are high in vegetable oils, refined grains, and additives may help reduce your risk of diabetes (43 \ue90f, 44 \ue90f). This may be partly due to the anti-diabetes effects of whole foods like nuts, vegetables, and fruits.
