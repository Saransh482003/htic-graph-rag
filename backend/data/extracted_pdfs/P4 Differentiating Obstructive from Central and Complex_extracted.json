The respiratory abnormalities range from complete cessation of air\ufb02ow (apneas) with continued respiratory effort, to discernable reductions in air\ufb02ow (hypopneas), to \ufb02ow limitation- recovery breath sequences.1,2 The duration of signi\ufb01cant abnor\u00ad mality is usually 10 seconds or more, but use of \ufb02ow monitoring with the nasal cannula-pressure transducer system can show an evolution over much longer or shorter intervals.2 Central apneas, periodic breathing (a pattern of waxing and waning respiratory effort), and Cheyne-Stokes respiration are patterns that suggest chemoreceptor-mediated respiratory control dysfunction.3 Tradi\u00ad tionally, central apnea syndromes are de\ufb01ned by a central apnea index \u22655/h of sleep and a predominance of central events relative to the total events scored. This stringent approach may under\u00ad estimate the contribution of chemore\ufb02ex abnormalities to sleep apnea pathogenesis. Moreover, accurate discrimination between obstructive and central hypopneas is thought to be unreliable us\u00ad ing visual pattern recognition methods based on respiratory band and air\ufb02ow signals; it requires esophageal manometry to quantify instantaneous respiratory effort.1 There is evidence that central and obstructive features may co\u00ad exist in many individuals with sleep apnea. Reduced and oscillat\u00ad ing motor tone to the upper airway can result in intermittent upper airway collapse in those with hypoxia-induced periodic breath\u00ad ing,4 and direct visualization of the upper airway reveals collapse at the nadir of the respiratory cycle to be common in central sleep apnea.5 As all respiratory events with evidence of \ufb02ow limitation or presence of respiratory effort are conventionally scored as \u201cob\u00ad structive\u201d events, the role of respiratory control mechanisms in sleep apnea is likely further underestimated. We de\ufb01ne complex sleep apnea as sleep disordered breathing secondary to simulta\u00ad neous upper airway obstruction and respiratory control dysfunc\u00ad tion.6,7 This pathophysiological de\ufb01nition results in predictable characteristics: 1) A polysomnographic pattern\u2014respiratory os\u00ad cillations that have a single dominant frequency due to chemore\u00ad \ufb02ex driving and an improvement during REM sleep. 2) A speci\ufb01c Differentiating Obstructive from Central and Complex Sleep Apnea Using an Automated Electrocardiogram-Based Method Robert Joseph Thomas, MD, MMSc1; Joseph E.

The objective of this study was to assess the utility of an electrocardiogram (ECG)-based cardiopulmonary coupling technique to distinguish obstructive from central or complex sleep apnea. Design: Analysis of archived polysomnographic datasets. Setting: A laboratory for computational signal analysis. Interventions: None. Measurements and Results: The PhysioNet Sleep Apnea Database, consisting of 70 polysomnograms including single-lead ECG signals of approximately 8 hours duration, was used to train an ECG-based mea\u00ad sure of autonomic and respiratory interactions (cardiopulmonary coupling) to detect periods of apnea and hypopnea, based on the presence of el\u00ad evated low-frequency coupling (e-LFC). In the PhysioNet BIDMC Conges\u00ad tive Heart Failure Database (ECGs of 15 subjects), a pattern of \u201cnarrow spectral band\u201d e-LFC was especially common. The algorithm was then applied to the Sleep Heart Health Study\u2013I dataset, to select the 15 records with the highest amounts of broad and narrow spectral band e-LFC. The latter spectral characteristic seemed to detect not only periods of central apnea, but also obstructive hypopneas with a periodic breathing pattern. Applying the algorithm to 77 sleep laboratory split-night studies showed that the presence of narrow band e-LFC predicted an increased sensitivity to induction of central apneas by positive airway pressure. Conclusions: ECG-based spectral analysis allows automated, operator- independent characterization of probable interactions between respirato\u00ad ry dyscontrol and upper airway anatomical obstruction. The clinical utility of spectrographic phenotyping, especially in predicting failure of positive airway pressure therapy, remains to be more thoroughly tested.

Complex sleep apnea is different from central sleep apnea as the majority of apneas and hypopneas are obstructive, but the oscillatory pattern has a strong resem\u00ad blance to periodic breathing. This syndrome is thus a mixture of obstructive sleep apnea and hypopnea with a periodic breathing pattern frequently made more overt, often with the induction of central apneas, by the pneumatic stabilization of the upper airway with positive airway pressure. A recent study suggested a relatively high prevalence of com\u00ad plex sleep apnea in clinical practice8 but required positive airway pressure titration-induced central apneas and periodic breathing for diagnosis. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has recently promulgated a de\ufb01nition of complex sleep apnea that requires: 1) an obstructive apnea hypopnea index \u22655/h on the di\u00ad agnostic polysomnogram, and 2) a central apnea-hypopnea index of \u22655/h, which is more than half of all scored respiratory events, during positive airway pressure titration. Because central hypop\u00ad neas are rarely scored in clinical practice, the de\ufb01nition essen\u00ad tially requires the occurrence of central apneas that make up more than 50% of all other scored respiratory events, a threshold that could miss clinically signi\ufb01cant nonobstructive sleep apnea. A technique to identify the presence of central ventilatory instability on diagnostic polysomnograms that is not dependent on the iden\u00ad ti\ufb01cation of central apneas alone could be clinically useful, since such patients may not fully respond to positive airway pressure therapy, which primarily targets upper airway obstruction. Highly predictable and almost metronomic oscillations of heart rate, blood pressure, arousals, and ventilation are well known features of sleep apnea syndromes driven by respiratory control dysfunction.9-12 In contrast, the upper airway consists of multiple interacting components that could exhibit variable intrinsic os\u00ad cillatory patterns.13-16 We therefore hypothesized that a primarily obstructive upper airway abnormality would result in variable event-to-event cycle times, and that this difference in the regu\u00ad larity of pure obstructive versus central or complex sleep apnea would facilitate discrimination of these two syndromes. We re\u00ad cently developed and validated a method of characterizing cardio\u00ad pulmonary interactions using time series analysis of a single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG).12 This methodology involves extract\u00ad ing and mathematically combining heart rate variability and ECG-derived respiration (as determined by amplitude modulation of the QRS complex associated with breathing). This ECG-based method generates a spectrographic measure of \u201ccardiopulmonary coupling.\u201d Two basic patterns of cardiopulmonary coupling are demonstrable in health and disease: high-frequency coupling (HFC), associated with breath-to-breath stability of tidal volume and sinus arrhythmia; and low-frequency coupling (LFC), associ\u00ad ated with breath-to-breath cycles of \ufb02uctuating tidal volumes and cyclic variation in heart rate, usually recurring every 25-50 sec\u00ad onds, seen in health but markedly accentuated in those with sleep apnea.12 We hypothesized that relatively pure obstructive sleep apnea would result in multiple broad bands of low-frequency car\u00ad diopulmonary coupling spectral peaks, while central or complex sleep apnea, strongly in\ufb02uenced by instabilities in chemoreceptor control, would demonstrate cyclic oscillations at a relatively \ufb01xed frequency, resulting in a narrow band of low-frequency cardio\u00ad pulmonary coupling. To test this hypothesis, we \ufb01rst used an annotated sleep apnea database to train the cardiopulmonary coupling algorithm to de\u00ad tect periods of sleep apnea regardless of etiology or type, based on a subset of LFC oscillations, elevated LFC or e-LFC, that cor\u00ad relate with apneas and hypopneas. We then used a Holter monitor database of congestive heart failure subjects to train the algorithm to speci\ufb01cally detect central apnea-like physiological oscillations, based on the presence of narrow spectral band e-LFC. To con\ufb01rm concordance between visual scoring and spectrographic types of sleep apnea, we applied the algorithm to polysomnograms ac\u00ad quired by the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) that contained the highest amounts of either narrow spectral band e-LFC or broad spectral band e-LFC. Finally, we assessed the prevalence of the different types of cardiopulmonary coupling in SHHS sub\u00ad jects with an AHI \u22655, contrasting polysomnographic severity of those with and without narrow spectral band e-LFC. METHODS Subjects PhysioNet Sleep Apnea Database The open-access PhysioNet Sleep Apnea Database (http:// www.physionet.org/physiobank/database/apnea-ecg/) was used to train the apnea detection algorithm to identify sleep apnea, as described below. This database (Table 1) consists of 70 single- lead ECG signals of approximately 8 hours, digitized at 100 Hz, extracted from full laboratory polysomnograms. Each recording includes a set of reference annotations, one for each minute of the recording, which indicates the presence or absence of apnea or hypopnea during that minute. All apneas in these recordings are either obstructive or mixed. The original reference annota\u00ad tions were made by an experienced sleep researcher on the basis of simultaneously recorded respiration signals. Thermistors were used for \ufb02ow estimates. As a 50% reduction in amplitude accom\u00ad panied by a drop in oxygen saturation of at least 4% and fol\u00ad lowed by compensating hyperventilation was required for scoring hypopneas, the respiratory events were severe. The subjects of these recordings are men and women between 27 and 60 years of age, with weights between 53 and 135 kg and AHI ranges from 0 to 93.5. The 70 polysomnogram recordings were divided into 3 groups based on the number of epochs containing apneas or hypopneas: a) No/trivial disease: 20 recordings from 11 men and 9 women, aged 27 to 42 years, containing fewer than 5 minutes with apnea or hypopnea during the recording; b) Moderate: 10 recordings from 8 men and 2 women, aged 39 to 53 years, which contain between 5 and 99 minutes with apnea during the record\u00ad ing; and c) Severe: 40 recordings from 38 men and 2 women, aged 29 to 63 years, which contain at least 100 minutes with ap\u00ad nea during the recording.

This database consists of 15 subjects (11 men, aged 22 to 71, and 4 women, aged 54 to 63) with severe congestive heart failure (NYHA class 3-4). The individual recordings are each about 20 hours and contain 2 continuous ECG signals each sampled at 250 samples per second. This group of subjects was part of a larger study group receiving conventional medical therapy prior to receiving the oral inotro\u00ad pic agent, milrinone. The original analog recordings were made at Boston\u2019s Beth Israel Hospital (now the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center) using ambulatory ECG recorders. This dataset did not contain reference apnea annotations. One subject was ex\u00ad cluded because of atrial \ufb01brillation. Sleep Heart Health Study-I The trained apnea detection algorithm was then used to ana\u00ad lyze the SHHS data. The characteristics of the SHHS have been described in detail.17,18 Unattended overnight PSG was performed with a portable PS-2 system (Compumedics, Abottsville, Austra\u00ad lia). Sensors were placed and equipment was calibrated during an evening home visit by a certi\ufb01ed technician. Data collection in\u00ad cluded C3/A1 and C4/A2 EEGs; right and left electrooculograms; a bipolar submental electromyogram; thoracic and abdominal excursions (inductive plethysmography bands); air\ufb02ow (detected by a nasal-oral thermocouple [Protec, Woodinville, WA]); \ufb01nger pulse oximetry (Nonin, Minneapolis, MN) sampled at 1 Hz; elec\u00ad trocardiogram (ECG) sampled at 125 Hz; body position (mercury gauge sensor); and ambient light (on/off, by a light sensor secured to the recording garment). After equipment retrieval, the data were forwarded to a central Reading Center (Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH) for scoring according to a standard protocol. The polysomnographic methods, scoring protocol, and quality assurance procedures have been previously described.17,18 Cardiopulmonary Coupling Analysis and Generation of Sleep Spectrograms The cardiopulmonary coupling technique12 is based on a con\u00ad tinuous ECG signal and uses the Fourier Transform to analyze 2 features of the signal: 1) heart rate variability and 2) the \ufb02uctua\u00ad tions in R-wave amplitude induced by respiration. These signals tend to have to have two basic patterns: a high-frequency compo\u00ad nent due to physiological sinus arrhythmia that re\ufb02ects breath-to- breath \ufb02uctuations and a low-frequency component that re\ufb02ects cyclic variation across multiple breaths. Quanti\ufb01cation of cardiac and respiratory interactions involves calculating the cross-power and coherence between these 2 signals. The steps involved in the calculation of cardiopulmonary cou\u00ad pling are as follows: 1) An automated beat detection algorithm is used to detect beats, classify them as either normal or ectopic, and determine amplitude variations in the QRS complex. From these amplitude variations a surrogate ECG-derived respiratory signal (EDR) is obtained. 2) A time series of normal-to-normal si\u00ad nus (NN) intervals and the time series of the EDR associated with these NN intervals are then extracted from the RR interval time series. 3) Outliers due to false or missed R-wave detections are re\u00ad moved using a sliding window average \ufb01lter with a window of 41 data points and rejection of central points lying outside 20% of the window average. 4) The resulting NN interval series and its asso\u00ad ciated EDR are then cubic spline resampled at 2 Hz. 5) The cross spectral power and coherence of these two signals are calculated over a 1024-sample (8.5 minute) window using the Fast Fourier Transform applied to the 3 overlapping 512-sample subwindows within the 1024-sample coherence window. The 1024-sample co\u00ad herence window is then advanced by 256 samples (2.1 min) and the calculation repeated until the entire NN interval/EDR series is analyzed. For each 1024-sample window the product of the coherence and cross-spectral power is used to calculate the ratio of coherent cross power in the low-frequency (0.01-0.1 Hz) band to that in the high-frequency (0.1-0.4 Hz) band. A preponderance of power in the low-frequency band tends to be associated with periodic sleep behaviors, while predominance of power in the high-frequency band is associated with respiratory sinus arrhythmia and sleep with stable respiration and EEG.12 A preponderance of power in the very-low-frequency (0-0.01 Hz) band is associated with peri\u00ad ods of wakefulness or REM sleep. This technique thus generates a moving average of the dominant oscillatory frequencies of au\u00ad tonomic drive coupled with respiration during sleep. Cardiopulmonary Coupling Analysis and Estimation of Elevated Low Frequency Coupling (e-LFC) Subtypes Analysis of the PhysioNet Sleep Apnea Database using the car\u00ad diopulmonary coupling technique indicated that elevated power in the low-frequency coupling region coincided with periods of scored apnea/hypopnea. Optimal detection thresholds required that the minimum low-frequency power be >0.05 normalized units and that the low to high frequency ratio be >30 to de\ufb01ne pe\u00ad riods of probable apnea/hypopnea, which we term elevated LFC (e-LFC). Since the apneas and hypopneas in this database were scored in 60-s epochs and cardiopulmonary coupling measure\u00ad ments made every 2.1 min, 60-s linear interpolation between con\u00ad secutive 2.1-min measurements was done. The 70 recordings in this database contained a total of 34,243 minutes of which 13,062 (38%) were scored as containing episodes of apnea/hypopnea. Sensitivities and speci\ufb01cities for minute-by-minute apnea detec\u00ad tion were calculated for a range of low-frequency coupling pow\u00ad ers and low/high coupling ratios. Receiver-operator curves were then calculated and the thresholds giving the maximum combined sensitivity and speci\ufb01city for apnea/hypopnea detection was se\u00ad lected as optimal. Thus, e-LFC is de\ufb01ned here as a subset of low-frequency coupled cardiopulmonary oscillations, periods of which correlated signi\ufb01cantly with periods of manually scored apneas and hypopneas in the PhysioNet Sleep Apnea Database. Some spectrograms from the PhysioNet Sleep Apnea Database demonstrated periods of near-constant frequency spectral peaks in the e-LFC region that was reminiscent of the sinusoidal os\u00ad cillations of heart rate variability seen in Cheyne-Stokes respi\u00ad ration in heart failure patients, which has a relatively constant cycle length.14-16 To explore this phenomenon further, we applied the algorithm to the PhysioNet Congestive Heart Failure Data\u00ad base, with the expectation that the database would provide more prolonged episodes with central periodic oscillations. Since the times during which these subjects were sleeping are not known, the 6 continuous hours of lowest heart rate was taken as the puta\u00ad tive sleep time. Since the period of central apnea can be as slow as 120 seconds or longer, we used the frequency band between 0.006 and 0.1 Hz to de\ufb01ne narrow spectral band e-LFC (putative Sleep Spectrograms Detect Central and Complex Sleep Apnea\u2014Thomas et al",

        "text": "SLEEP, Vol. 30, No. 12, 2007 1759 central sleep apnea, periodic breathing, or complex sleep apnea). We required (1) a minimum power in this band of 0.3 normalized units and (2) that the coupling frequency of each pair of consecu\u00ad tive measurements remains within 0.0059 Hz of each other over 5 consecutive sampling windows (totaling 17 continuous min). Periods of e-LFC not meeting these criteria were de\ufb01ned as broad spectral band e-LFC (putative pure obstructive sleep apnea). The amounts of broad and narrow spectral band coupling in e-LFC bands were then expressed as the percentage of windows detected in relation to the total sleep period. Thus, the narrow spectral band e-LFC identi\ufb01ed periods with oscillations that have a single domi\u00ad nant coupling frequency, suggesting central sleep apnea or peri\u00ad odic breathing. The broad spectral band e-LFC identi\ufb01ed periods with oscillations that have variable coupling frequencies, suggest\u00ad ing an alternative mechanism, which we posited was dominance of anatomic upper airway obstructive processes. As it takes 17 min of continuous narrow-band cardiopulmonary coupling to reach the detection threshold, we estimated that this would be ap\u00ad proximately equal to an averaged central apnea index of 5/h of sleep, assuming 6 h of sleep and a periodic breathing cycle length of approximately 35 seconds. Spectrographic Analysis of the SHHS Database Clinical characteristics of the subjects selected from the SHHS were obtained from the SHHS Coordinating Center. Rules for scoring respiratory events in the SHHS have been previously reported.19 Sleep stages were scored according to the guidelines developed by Rechtschaffen and Kales.20 Arousals were identi\u00ad \ufb01ed according to American Sleep Disorders Association criteria,21 modi\ufb01ed to accommodate situations in which electromyogram artifact obscured the EEG signal. The common criterion to de\ufb01ne an apnea (regardless of the nature of corroborating physiologic occurrences) was a complete or almost complete cessation of air\ufb02ow (<25% of baseline), as measured by the amplitude of the thermocouple signal, lasting \u226510 s. The common criterion to de\u00ad \ufb01ne hypopnea (regardless of the nature of corroborating physi\u00ad ologic occurrences) was a clear reduction in the amplitude of \ufb02ow or volume (detected by the thermocouple or by thorax or ab\u00ad dominal inductance band signals) to below 70% of the amplitude of \u201cbaseline\u201d breathing for \u226510 s, but one that did not meet the criterion for apnea. Apneas were considered to be \u201ccentral\u201d if no effort was noted on both the thorax and abdominal effort chan\u00ad nel. No attempt was made to classify hypopneas as obstructive or central in nature. After apneas and hypopneas were identi\ufb01ed, software linked each event to data from the oxygen saturation and EEG channels. Each event was then characterized according to the degree of maximum associated desaturation (occurring up to 25 s after the end of the event) and to the presence of associated arousal (occurring up to 3 s after the event). Discrete respiratory disturbance indices were calculated on the basis of the air\ufb02ow or volume criteria in conjunction with various combinations of as\u00ad sociated desaturation and arousal. For this analysis, we considered the AHI based on events associated with 4% desaturation. Of the 6430 SHHS-I polysomnograms available for analysis, 1183 did not meet the following inclusion criteria: a minimum of 4 h of available ECG data, no drop out of ECG signal for contigu\u00ad ous periods of more than 4 min, and \u226580% of R waves annotated by the software as normal R waves. Thus, studies with high rates of ectopy, atrial \ufb01brillation, and excessively tall T waves that in\u00ad terfered with accurate QRS detection were excluded. An addi\u00ad tional 1258 polysomnograms were excluded because sensor loss prevented scoring of central apnea by the SHHS Reading Center. These exclusions left 3989 studies suitable for comparing the full range of conventional scoring and spectrographic phenotyping. The 15 studies with the highest percentage of narrow spectral band e-LFC (Group I) and the 15 studies with the highest percent\u00ad age of broad spectral band e-LFC (Group II) were selected for further analysis, as described below (\u201cextreme\u201d groups, Table 2). Examples of sleep spectrograms derived from SHHS polysom\u00ad nograms, shown in Figures 1-4, demonstrate: 1) healthy sleep; 2) predominant broad spectral band e-LFC; 3) predominant narrow spectral band e-LFC; 4) alternating narrow and broad spectral band e-LFC. Sleep Laboratory Titration Response Database A retrospective assessment was performed of archived poly\u00ad somnographic data from consecutive patients seen in the AASM- accredited Multidisciplinary Sleep Disorders Center at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts between January and June 2005. IRB approval was obtained for access to the raw polysomnographic data, sleep study reports, and clinical covariates. The polysomnographic selection criteria were: 1) Di\u00ad agnostic polysomnogram with subsequent positive airway pres\u00ad sure titration polysomnogram, or split night polysomnogram. 2) Apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) \u226510. Exclusion criteria were: 1) Low awake baseline oxygen saturations (\u226492%). 2) Presumed hypoventilation, identi\ufb01ed by oxygen saturations \u226490% with pos\u00ad itive airway pressure optimized to control obstruction and \ufb02ow- limitation during sleep; 3) nocturnal oxygen use; 4) diabetes with retinopathy, neuropathy, or nephropathy; heart failure; chronic re\u00ad nal failure on dialysis; or stroke; 5) use of sedative or antidepres\u00ad sant medications, 6) cardiac rhythm disturbances that preclude or degrade cardiopulmonary coupling analysis (atrial \ufb01brillation, ventricular bigeminy or trigeminy, demand or biventricular car\u00ad diac pacing); 7) total sleep time <4 h on the diagnostic assess\u00ad ment if not a split-night study; and 8) mask intolerance due to claustrophobia. Of 546 sleep studies, 77 were selected for further analysis. The most common cause for exclusion was use of ex\u00ad clusionary medications (321 subjects). Others included wake or sleep hypoventilation (34), cardiac arrhythmia (28), inadequate total sleep time (16), and high risk clinical condition (88). More than one reason for exclusion was present in 18 subjects. The rationales for some of these strict exclusionary criteria for the preliminary assessment of our technique were as follows: 1) Subjects with hypoventilation syndromes may have abnormal (reduced) chemosensitivity and thus be less likely to exhibit pe\u00ad riodic breathing; moreover, supplemental oxygen may have been used that could reduce periodic breathing. 2) Those with baseline oxygen desaturation may acclimatize to hypoxia and thus exhibit some resistance to periodic breathing. 3) Patients with advanced diabetes, heart failure, post-stroke and renal failure are known to be at high risk for complex sleep apnea, and the target sample for this preliminary analysis was the typical sleep laboratory patient devoid of high risk features. 4) Sedative medications may reduce periodic breathing periods by increasing the proportion of stable NREM sleep and thus cause false negative results, while antide\u00ad pressants have complex and not fully de\ufb01ned effects on upper airway physiology.

Our laboratory routinely attempts to evaluate bilevel pressure fol\u00ad lowing continuous pressure titration to avoid repeat assessments secondary to home pressure intolerance. In those who have cen\u00ad tral apneas on CPAP, bilevel positive airway pressure with and without a back-up rate and narrow inspiratory-expiratory (2-4 cm H2O) pressure difference is evaluated. If there was any worsening of sleep apnea control, as can happen in those with central or com\u00ad plex sleep apnea, bilevel pressure was immediately discontinued with a return to CPAP. Determination of Positive Airway Pressure Titration Outcome All titrations were reviewed blindly epoch-by-epoch by a board certi\ufb01ed sleep specialist to assess polysomnographic suc\u00ad cess or failure. Adequate control of sleep apnea was de\ufb01ned as elimination of apneas, hypopneas, \ufb02ow limitation, desaturations, and respiratory-related arousals during REM and unstable NREM sleep. The residual RDI when control was adequate was \u22645 per hour of sleep. The clinical criterion for positive airway pressure titration failure was a central apnea index of \u22655 per hour of sleep at or below the pressure required to control upper airway obstruc\u00ad tion on the titration component of the polysomnogram. Statistical Analysis Descriptive statistics are presented regarding the performance of the cardiopulmonary coupling algorithm in the development databases (PhysioNet Sleep Apnea and Congestive Heart Fail\u00ad ure Databases). Clinical characteristics and polysomnographic features of the 2 groups of SHHS subjects (predominant narrow spectral band e-LFC and predominant broad spectral band e-LFC) were compared using independent sample t-tests or chi-square tests as appropriate. In the SHHS-I dataset, using those with an apnea-hypopnea index of \u22655/h of sleep (2499 polysomnograms), correlation coef\ufb01cients were estimated between automated detec\u00ad tion of central sleep apnea (percentage of windows with narrow spectral band e-LFC) and conventional event scoring (central ap\u00ad nea index). For evaluation of positive airway pressure titration response, both the presence of narrow spectral band e-LFC and success of positive airway pressure titration were considered as categorical variables. Comparison of polysomnographic and spectrographic variables between groups that had successful or failed titration used unpaired t-tests. Stepwise logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the odds ratio for titration success, adjusting for central apnea index, sleep apnea severity (AHI above or below 30/hr), sex, age, and oxygen desaturation severity. STATA/SE 8.0 was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS Sleep Apnea and Congestive Heart Failure Databases The \ufb01nal ECG-based algorithm for detecting sleep apnea based on the presence of low-frequency cardiopulmonary coupling was compared to sleep apnea detection by expert human scoring of the PhysioNet Sleep Apnea Database (Table 1). Based on scoring by an experienced human sleep researcher, for the entire sample of 70 subjects the mean AHI was 28.1 \u00b1 27.5 (range 0-93.5) events/ hour and 38% \u00b1 34% of sleep time contained apneas or hypop\u00ad neas. The ECG-based algorithm identi\ufb01ed e-LFC in 39% \u00b1 31% of sleep time. The overall coef\ufb01cient of correlation for the per\u00ad centage of recording time detected as e-LFC by the ECG-based method vs. the percentage of time scored as containing apneas or hypopneas by human scoring was r = 0.88, P < 0.01. Although human scoring identi\ufb01ed all apneas in this database as obstruc\u00ad tive or mixed in nature, the ECG-based algorithm identi\ufb01ed 28% \u00b1 21% of sleep time as containing obstructive sleep apnea based on the presence of broad spectral band e-LFC, and 12% \u00b1 18% of sleep time as central or complex sleep apnea based on the pres\u00ad ence of narrow spectral band e-LFC. The fraction of time detected as obstructive vs. central or complex sleep apnea differed across the three previously identi\ufb01ed subsets of this database: a) Severe sleep apnea: 0.38 \u00b1 0.20 vs. 0.20 \u00b1 0.20; b) Moderate sleep apnea: 0.23 \u00b1 0.12 vs. 0.02 \u00b1 0.04; and c) Minimal sleep apnea: 0.08 \u00b1 0.05 vs. 0.002 \u00b1 0.007. The percentage of total e-LFC that was narrow-band for the three groups was 34.0%, 8.3% and 1.8%, re\u00ad spectively. In the PhysioNet Congestive Heart Failure Database, the fraction of putative sleep time detected as broad-band (ob\u00ad structive) and narrow band (central or complex) sleep apnea was 0.19 \u00b1 0.16 and 0.18 \u00b1 0.23, respectively; thus, 48.0% of detected sleep apnea in this sample was identi\ufb01ed as central or complex.

When the analysis is restricted to the 2499 subjects with AHI-4% \u22655, central or complex sleep apnea de\ufb01ned by the presence of narrow spectral band e-LFC was present in 37% of subjects. The sex ratio was (male/female) 69.9/30.1 and 56.9/43.1 in the narrow vs. broad spectral band e-LFC groups, respectively (chi square P: < 0.001). The AHI was 22.9 \u00b1 18 and 13.7 \u00b1 10.9/h of sleep (t-test P: < 0.001), in those with and without narrow spec\u00ad tral band e-LFC. There was a modest but statistically signi\ufb01cant correlation between the percentage of time with narrow-band cou\u00ad pling and frequency of central apneas (r: 0.18, P < 0.001). Two groups of 15 SHHS-I subjects were identi\ufb01ed on the basis of high percentages of broad or narrow spectral band e-LFC, as described above. The 2 groups were similar in age, body mass in\u00ad dex, and daytime sleepiness as measured by Epworth Sleepiness Scale score. Sleep stage distribution was notable for a lower per\u00ad cent REM sleep in the group with narrow-band coupling (Table 2). Those with a predominance of narrow spectral band e-LFC also had a predominance of conventionally scored central apneas, with a nearly 6-fold higher central apnea index. In contrast to those with broad spectral band e-LFC, the AHI in the group with narrow spectral band e-LFC was higher in NREM than REM sleep, a pattern commonly seen during sleep at high altitude or in those with central sleep apnea. This group also had more severe obstructive disease, as demonstrated by the higher frequency of obstructive apneas, and lower minimum saturations. Sleep Laboratory Titration Response Database Subject and Polysomnographic Characteristics These subjects (n=77) had very severe sleep apnea, as dem\u00ad onstrated by daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale score of 14 \u00b1 3.2) and high AHI (47.2 \u00b1 15.7), and had predominantly obstructive disease by conventional scoring.

The reduced total sleep time seen in those with narrow spectral band e-LFC may in part re\ufb02ect earlier application of therapy due to greater disease severity. Positive Airway Pressure Titration Outcomes Forty of the 77 analyzed polysomnograms were combined di\u00ad agnostic and therapeutic assessments (\u201csplit-night\u201d studies), of which 28 were in the group with complex sleep apnea based on failure of positive airway pressure titration). Using a threshold of \u22655 central apneas per hour of sleep, only 16 subjects (21%) would have been identi\ufb01ed as having complex sleep apnea. All subjects were \ufb01rst evaluated with CPAP. Bilevel positive pressure therapy, with and without a back-up rate when central apneas were induced, was evaluated in 62 subjects, including 100% in the complex sleep apnea group and 64% of the group with successful positive airway pressure titration. The mean continuous positive pressure that controlled \ufb02ow-limitation was 12 \u00b1 2.1 cm H2O in the group with successful titration, compared to a maximum tolerated pres\u00ad sure without worsening periodic breathing and central apneas of 8.2 \u00b1 2.3 cm H2O in the group with failed titration. Bilevel posi\u00ad tive airway pressure application (inspiratory pressure range 7-18 and expiratory pressure range 5-12) was noted to worsen respira\u00ad tory instability in 26 of 35 (74%) of the group with failed titration, but in none of the group with successful titration. The duration of bilevel positive pressure application was 42%\u00b1 12% vs. 8% \u00b1 4% of total titration time in the successful vs. failed titration groups. In contrast to those with successful positive airway pressure titra\u00ad tion, sleep quality and sleep disordered breathing remained mark\u00ad edly abnormal in those with positive pressure titration failure due to induction of complex sleep apnea (Table 4). High frequency coupling was increased to a greater extent than conventionally scored slow wave sleep during successful pressure titration. Predictive Value of Polysomnographic and Spectrographic Measures In stepwise regression analysis, the presence of narrow spec\u00ad tral band e-LFC was the strongest predictor of success or failure of positive airway pressure titration. Only two of the 32 (6.3%) subjects with the presence of any narrow spectral band e-LFC had a successful positive airway pressure titration, due to induc\u00ad tion of complex sleep apnea. In those without narrow spectral band e-LFC, only 5 of 45 (11%) failed titration due to induction of complex sleep apnea. The adjusted (for age, sex, body mass index, AHI, central apnea index, and minimal nocturnal desatura\u00ad tion) odds ratio of positive airway pressure titration success in the presence of narrow spectral band e-LFC was 0.001 (CI: 0.0- 0.04; chi square = 66.4, P: < 0.001); unadjusted odds ratios are summarized in Table 5. As a method to predict successful posi\u00ad tive airway pressure titration, the spectrographic measure had the following predictive characteristics: speci\ufb01city: 95.2%, sensitiv\u00ad ity: 85.7%, positive predictive value: 88.9%, negative predictive value: 93.7%, correctly classi\ufb01ed: 90.9%.

        "text": "SLEEP, Vol. 30, No. 12, 2007 1767 derived spectrographic narrow spectral band e-LFC was superior to categorization based on severity of nocturnal oxygen desatura\u00ad tion, sleep apnea severity, or a conventional central apnea index threshold (\u22655/h of sleep) (Table 5). DISCUSSION In the present study, we have described a method to classify sleep apnea based on spectral pro\ufb01les of ECG-based cardiopul\u00ad monary coupling. The 2 spectral pro\ufb01les, broad-band and narrow- band, are visually distinctive. While the ability of these different spectral pro\ufb01les to discriminate central from obstructive sleep apnea appears generally concordant with human visual-manual scoring, the cardiopulmonary coupling method detects more cen\u00ad tral-appearing sleep apnea than do conventional respiratory scor\u00ad ing approaches. The presence of narrow spectral band e-LFC iden\u00ad ti\ufb01es subjects with evidence of a prominent central component to their sleep apnea, as indicated by a high proportion of central apneas and a relative NREM predominance of apneas and hypop\u00ad neas. The results in the heart failure database should be taken with caution. Sleep and breathing were not recorded, the putative sleep time is a rough estimate, and it is not really known if the subjects had periodic breathing. However, the presence of relatively large amounts of narrow spectral band e-LFC in patients with heart fail\u00ad ure was an important intermediate step in our conceptualization of the sleep spectrographic approach to phenotyping sleep apnea. Among SHHS-I subjects with AHI \u22655, those with narrow spec\u00ad tral band e-LFC had greater disease severity and a more striking male predominance than those with purely broad band e-LFC. A similar male preponderance has been described for central sleep apnea in heart failure.24 There is also evidence that respiratory control dysfunction contributes to severity of obstructive sleep apnea.25-27 Thus, the cardiopulmonary coupling methodology may be capable of noninvasively providing insights into the complex interactions between respiratory control and upper airway ob\u00ad struction. We speculate that the presence of elevated narrow spec\u00ad tral band e-LFC re\ufb02ects abnormal chemore\ufb02ex modulation of res\u00ad piration during sleep regardless of the exact polysomnographic event designation (obstructive or central apnea, hypopnea, or periodic breathing), although the present study does not provide direct evidence of this. Thus, central and complex sleep apnea, and periodic breathing, can be thought to be driven in part by aberrant chemore\ufb02ex modulation of respiratory control. CPAP- induced central sleep apnea is a characteristic of complex sleep apnea, but both central and complex sleep apnea have identical spectral signatures\u2014they cannot be distinguished by the spectro\u00ad graphic technique. Our preliminary \ufb01ndings suggest that the classi\ufb01cation of sleep apnea syndromes based on the 2 distinct spectral pro\ufb01les, nar\u00ad row spectral band e-LFC and broad spectral band e-LFC, may have clinical utility. In a preliminary assessment, the presence of narrow spectral band e-LFC was able to identify individuals at high risk for the induction of central apneas during positive airway pressure titration with high accuracy. This characteristic pattern may, therefore, permit identi\ufb01cation of individuals with \u201ccomplex sleep apnea\u201d during diagnostic polysomnograms, prior to application of positive airway pressure therapy. Neither central apnea index nor the severity of sleep apnea (as re\ufb02ected by the AHI or oxygen desaturation) during the diagnostic polysomno\u00ad gram reliably predicted positive airway pressure failure. Bilevel positive airway pressure can induce or worsen central sleep ap\u00ad nea, and our routine evaluation of bilevel pressure therapy may have ampli\ufb01ed differences between groups. However, the short duration of bilevel positive airway pressure assessment in those with complex sleep apnea suggests that this did not have a large impact on the \ufb01ndings.

Mixed patterns of coupling spectra are presumed to re\ufb02ect varying de\u00ad grees of anatomical and respiratory control dysfunction, although more intensive physiologic studies are needed to con\ufb01rm this hy\u00ad pothesis. As esophageal manometry, the gold standard for respira\u00ad tory effort and central apnea detection,28 was not available in any of the polysomnograms analyzed, the relationships of esophageal pressure patterns with cardiopulmonary-coupling detected com\u00ad plex physiology cannot be established from our data. Whether increased hypoxic or hypocapnic sensitivity explains some of the variance in coupling characteristics merits further study. The ECG-based cardiopulmonary coupling methodology has several advantages over conventional visual scoring of polysom\u00ad nograms. The method is automated, reliable, easily repeated, and relatively inexpensive. It may permit classi\ufb01cation of periods of hypopneas as central versus obstructive; although hypopneas con\u00ad stitute the large majority of scored respiratory events, they are typically not classi\ufb01ed as central or obstructive due to the limita\u00ad tions of conventional polysomnographic methodology. Accurate classi\ufb01cation of respiratory abnormality during sleep may allow improved risk strati\ufb01cation in epidemiological studies and may also improve therapy in patients with sleep apnea. Increasing evi\u00ad dence suggests that positive airway pressure fails to adequately treat those in whom respiratory control abnormality is signi\ufb01\u00ad cant.6,29 These groups may include patients with stroke,30 conges\u00ad tive heart failure,31 idiopathic central apnea, and those who have NREM-dominant obstructive disease.6 Such patients may need a multimodality approach that includes positive airway pressure, adaptive servo-ventilation, supplemental oxygen, minimization of hypocapnia, and stabilization of sleep state.7,32-34 Sleep spec\u00ad trograms could help both to improve diagnostic accuracy and to allow estimation of therapeutic ef\ufb01cacy. The cardiopulmo\u00ad nary coupling methodology may also allow dynamic tracking of pathophysiology across a night. For example, switches between anatomic and respiratory control dysfunction may occur with changes in body position, sleep stage, time of night, or positive airway pressure therapy. It may suggest respiratory control dys\u00ad function as a cause of failure of positive airway pressure therapy, if narrow spectral band e-LFC persists, or if broad converted to narrow spectral band e-LFC during treatment. With the availabil\u00ad ity of new forms of positive airway pressure therapy and adjunc\u00ad tive approaches to management of nonobstructive forms of sleep apnea, phenotyping using methods that complement conventional approaches may better select patients who may bene\ufb01t from these modalities. However, the clinical usefulness of such an approach remains unproven. Limitations of the cardiopulmonary coupling methodology include the lack of respiratory event severity quanti\ufb01cation and unreliability in the presence of atrial \ufb01brillation or frequent ven\u00ad tricular ectopy. Thus, in populations at high risk for arrhythmias, such as heart failure, there may be signi\ufb01cant limitations using ECG alone. Using direct air\ufb02ow measures may overcome some of these limitations. As methodological constraints require a min\u00ad imum of 17 min of sustained narrow-band coupling for detection, shorter sequences of central apneas, or repetitive brief clusters of central apneas and periodic breathing may not be detected as such. Due to the averaging inherent in the technique, if mixtures of central and obstructive respiratory events are present within the analysis window, the sleep spectrogram could underestimate or overestimate either the narrow band or broad band component. Thus, the described technique is more likely to prove useful as an adjunct to, rather than a replacement for, standard polysom\u00ad nography, providing phenotypic information in certain circum\u00ad stances with greater accuracy than otherwise possible by visual event-based scoring. Our preliminary assessment of the value of the sleep spectrogram in predicting positive airway pressure fail\u00ad ure is limited by the stringent patient selection; its generalizabil\u00ad ity to an unselected sleep laboratory population requires testing. Moreover, the ability of the spectrographic technique to predict long-term clinical outcome is not unknown, nor can its accuracy in identifying complex sleep apnea in those with milder but clini\u00ad cally signi\ufb01cant sleep apnea be inferred from our data. In summary, a spectrographic assessment of cardiopulmonary coupling using a single-lead ECG-based technique helps to dif\u00ad ferentiate sleep apnea phenotypes (pure obstructive vs. central or complex) that may usefully complement conventional approach\u00ad es. Such differences may be evident on the diagnostic polysom\u00ad nogram, prior to the initiation of positive airway pressure therapy. Detecting a very distinct ECG-based spectrographic pattern of e- LFC with a narrow-band pro\ufb01le may facilitate the identi\ufb01cation of disorders of respiratory control during sleep. The technique seems to hold promise in predicting failure of conventional posi\u00ad tive airway pressure titration.
