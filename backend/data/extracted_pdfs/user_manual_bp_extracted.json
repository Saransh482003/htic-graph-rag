Place the cuff directly against the skin, as clothing may cause a faint pulse, and result in a measurement error. 2. Constriction of the upper arm, caused by tightly rolling up a shirtsleeve, may prevent accurate readings. 3. Confirm that the index points within the proper fit range. 6. How to Take Proper Measurements For the most accurate blood pressure measurement: Sit comfortably on a chair. Rest your arm on the table. Do not cross your legs. Keep your feet on the floor and straighten your back. Relax for about five to ten minutes before measurement. Place the center of the cuff at the same level as your heart. Remain still and keep quiet during measurement. Do not measure immediately after physical exercise or a bath. Rest for twenty or thirty minutes before taking the measurement. Try to measure your blood pressure at the same time every day. 7. Measurement During the measurement, the cuff will become very tight. Do not be alarmed as this is normal. 8. After the Measurement After the measurement, remove the cuff and record your data. Note: Allow at least three minutes between measurements on the same person. Do not roll up shirtsleeve tightly 1 to 2 cm Air hose Cuff Index and Proper fit range Artery position mark Secure the fabric fastener firmly",

Set the PRESSURE switch to a value that will be 30 to 40 mmHg above the expected systolic value and press the START button. When the START button is pressed, all of the display symbols will appear for about one second. When the \"0\" is blinking, the device is calibrating its zero point. If there is still some air in the arm cuff, it will be exhausted at this time. The micro pump will pressurize the cuff. Note: The cuff will become very tight. Do not be alarmed, as this is normal. If the START button or clock button is pressed again during pressurization or during the measurement, the pump will stop and the air will be released from the cuff. 3. When pressurization has been completed, the automatic exhaust mechanism will gradually reduce the pressure in the cuff and the Measurement in Progress symbol will appear along with the current pressure reading. This symbol will flash in unison with the pulse of the person being monitored. Measurement in Progress",

        "text": "English 12 Measurements Accurate measurement cannot be made if the exhaust velocity is outside the range of 2 to 5 mmHg. This can be determined by watching the display each time the \"Measurement in Progress\" symbol blinks. Note the reading as the \"Measurement in Progress\" symbol blinks. Notes for Proper Measurements Sit in a comfortable position where you can place the arm to be used for the measurement on a table or other support that will place the center of the upper arm at about the same level as your heart. Relax for about five to ten minutes before starting the measurement. If you are excited or depressed by emotional stress, the measurement will reflect this stress as a higher (or lower) than normal blood pressure reading, the pulse reading will usually be faster than normal. A normal person's blood pressure varies constantly depending on what you are doing and on what you have eaten. What you drink can have a very strong and rapid affect on your blood pressure. As this device bases its measurements on the heart beat, if you have a very weak or irregular heart beat, the device may have difficulty determining your proper blood pressure. Should the device detect a condition that is abnormal, it will stop the measurement and display an error. See the section on description of display symbols for details. This blood pressure device is intended for use by adults only. Consult with your physician before using this device on a child. A child should not use this device unattended.",

        "text": "English 15 About Blood Pressure What is Blood Pressure? Blood pressure is the force exerted by blood against the walls of the arteries. Systolic pressure occurs when the heart contracts. Diastolic pressure occurs when the heart expands. Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). One's natural blood pressure is represented by the fundamental pressure, which is measured first thing in the morning while one is still at rest and before eating. What is Hypertension and How is it Controlled? Hypertension, which is abnormally high arterial blood pressure, if left unattended, can cause many health problems including stroke and heart attack. Hypertension can be controlled by altering one's lifestyle, avoiding stress, and with medication under a doctor\u2019s supervision. To prevent hypertension or keep it under control: Do not smoke Exercise regularly Reduce salt and fat intake Have regular physical checkups Maintain proper weight Why Measure Blood Pressure at Home? Blood pressure measured at a clinic or doctor's office may cause worry or apprehension and can produce an elevated reading, 25 to 30 mmHg higher than that measured at home. Home measurement reduces the effects of outside influences on blood pressure readings, supplements the doctor's readings and provides a more accurate, complete blood pressure history. WHO Blood Pressure Classification Standards to assess high blood pressure, without regard to age, have been established by the World Health Organization (WHO), as shown in the chart. Blood Pressure Variations An individual\u2019s blood pressure varies greatly on a daily and seasonal basis. It may vary by 30 to 50 mmHg due to various conditions during the day. In hypertensive individuals, variations are even more pronounced. Normally, the blood pressure rises while at work or play and falls to its lowest levels during sleep. So, do not be overly concerned by the results of one measurement. Take measurements at the same time every day using the procedure described in this manual to get to know your normal blood pressure.",
