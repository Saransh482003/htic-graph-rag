Device Description ARTSENS Plus PWV device measures Aortic Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV), through the analysis of synchronously and non-invasively captured pulse wave information from carotid and femoral artery sites. The device is connected to the host computer for performing the measurement and displaying the results. b. Intended Use The ARTSENS Plus PWV, Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV) device is intended to obtain PWV measurements. The device enables visualization and measurement of anatomical structures and fluid, including blood flow. It is to be used on those patients where information related to aortic PWV is desired but the risks of cardiac catheterization procedure or other invasive monitoring may outweigh the benefits.

Understanding your Pulse Wave Velocity test results Aortic PWV is a metric of arterial stiffness, generally considered a regional parameter as opposed to local. Stiffness and consequently, PWV of the person may vary depending on the food intake, medication, health, stress, and exercise. A higher PWV indicates higher stiffness. Although the relationship between aortic stiffness and cardiovascular events is continuous, a value greater than a threshold of 12 m/s has been suggested as a conservative estimate of significant alterations of aortic function in middle-aged hypertensives by 2007 ESH/ESC hypertension guidelines.
